# Front-End Boilerplate

## To Note

- In `.dependabot/config.yml`, change `default assignees:` to your own GitHub username or remove it completely.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
